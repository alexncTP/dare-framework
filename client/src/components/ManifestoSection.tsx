            <h3>Our Principles</h3>

            <h4>1. AI as a tool, not the master</h4>
            <p>
              We believe AI should amplify human creativity, not replace it. DARE positions AI as a collaborative asset within the designer’s toolkit—always guided by human vision, critical thinking, and creative intent.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Transparency over opacity</h4>
            <p>
              We champion clear communication about how and when AI is used in the design process. Clients, users, and teams deserve to understand the role automation plays in creative work.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Human-centered outcomes</h4>
            <p>
              The ultimate goal of design remains unchanged: to create solutions that meet human needs. AI should further this mission, never erode it through homogenization or a loss of empathy.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Adaptability with accountability</h4>
            <p>
              We acknowledge AI capabilities will continue to evolve. The DARE Framework offers a flexible structure for adopting new tools and techniques—while maintaining clear boundaries for responsible use.
            </p>

            <h4>5. Inclusive advancement</h4>
            <p>
              We support democratizing design while honoring the value of expertise. The right level of AI integration should be determined by the project’s needs, not simply by technical possibility.
