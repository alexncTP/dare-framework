            <h3>Our Principles</h3>
            
            <h4>1. AI as tool, not master</h4>
            <p>
              We believe artificial intelligence should amplify human creativity, not replace it. DARE positions AI as a collaborative tool in the designer's toolkit, subject to their creative direction and judgment.
            </p>
            
            <h4>2. Transparency over opacity</h4>
            <p>
              We advocate for clear communication about how and when AI is used in design processes. Clients, users, and teams deserve to understand the role automation plays in creative work.
            </p>
            
            <h4>3. Human-centric outcomes</h4>
            <p>
              The ultimate goal of design remains unchanged: creating solutions that serve human needs. AI should advance this mission, not compromise it through homogenization or diminished empathy.
            </p>
            
            <h4>4. Adaptability with responsibility</h4>
            <p>
              We recognize that AI capabilities will continue to evolve. The DARE Framework provides a flexible structure to incorporate new tools and techniques while maintaining responsible usage boundaries.
            </p>
            
            <h4>5. Inclusive advancement</h4>
            <p>
              We support the democratization of design while preserving the value of expertise. The right level of AI integration should be determined by project needs, not solely by technical capabilities.
